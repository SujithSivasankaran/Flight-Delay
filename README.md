## Introduction
Flight delays can cause significant inconvenience to passengers and airlines. This project aims to predict flight delays using historical flight data and machine learning techniques.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Flight-Delay.git
cd Flight-Delay
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model and make predictions, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes historical flight data with features such as departure time, arrival time, airline, and weather conditions. The data is stored in the `data` directory.

## Models
The project includes several machine learning models for predicting flight delays, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
